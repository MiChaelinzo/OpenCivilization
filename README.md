## About

OpenCiv is a love letter to turn-based strategy games inspired by Sid Meier's Civilization. The game mainly focuses on Civ 5 features and strives to improve on certain aspects that were lacking in the series.

The main objective of this project is to allow players who enjoy Civilization games to play it **directly on a web browser.**

## How do I build and run this?

To run a local instance, type `docker compose up -d`. (Make sure to have docker installed!)
To play, go to `localhost:1234` in your browser.

## How do I play this?

Currently, the project is being rewritten so no playable version is available without building the project.

## Keybinds

`ARROW KEYS` or `LEFT-CLICK DRAG` - Camera Movement

`SCROLL` - Zoom In/Out

`LEFT-CLICK` Unit `RIGHT-CLICK` Tile - Unit Movement

`SPACEBAR` - Skip turns

`ESC` - View settings
